This is my first "complete" application, i made this to practice my python skills
any help is much appreciated
How to use:
- Run Main.py 
- Insert the beatmapset id
- insert your osu apikey (if you dont have one get through here https://osu.ppy.sh/p/api)
(the api key will be saved on your computer on the keyapi.txt)
- run the script
- rename the cover.jpg to whatever you want 
update:
github wont let me upload the empty keyapi file, 
so you'll have to paste your key on the keyapi.txt
